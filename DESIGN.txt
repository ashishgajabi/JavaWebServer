General Details:
This web server runs on port 8080. 
Web Server is single threaded assuming that only one request will be served at a time. 
Web Server list down all directories and file from root location.
Directories can be further drilled down to sub-directories.
If its file then file content will be displayed on browser.

Improvements which can be done:
1. Third party logging libraries can be used to generate log files instead of putting logs to
   console.
2. Currently code assumes that there will be no spaces between files or directories name.
   This code further needs to be enhanced to handle situations like that.
3. Further enhancement needs to be done to handle situation where listed file is not 
   allowed\authorized to be read.
4. Further testing needs to be done on different platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac etc
5. Further testing needs to be done different browsers to make sure UI works properly.
